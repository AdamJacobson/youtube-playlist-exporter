# youtube-playlist-exporter

This is a JavaScriptlet which allows you to download any youtube playlist as a text file.

It first existed as script to be run inside of TamperMonkey which then broken when a recent Chrome update changed how third party scripts could run (or not run).

Currently, it must be copy pasted into your browser console in order to run.
